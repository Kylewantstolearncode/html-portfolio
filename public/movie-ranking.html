<h1>The Best Movies According to Kyle</h1>
<h2>My Top Movies of All Time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>La La Land</h3>
<p>A deep dive into the cost of ambition and the hardships of chasing your dreams diguised as a simple romance. Lead by relatable underdog protagonists and takes some daring risks with its narrative. Of course, the visuals and music are incredible as well</p>

<h3>Bladerunner 2049</h3>
<p>A slowburn sci-fi film that focuses less on flashy action sequences and more on discussing the concept of humanity. The question: "What makes someone human?" is asked through the view point of several fascinating inhuman characters. This is all wrapped around a movie with gorgeous cinematography</p>

<h3>Whisper of the Heart</h3>
<p>A gorgeously animated slice of life film that follows a young girl trying to find her place in life. Most might find this film to be mundane, but I think the slow pacing and simple narrative enhances the exploration of its themes.</p>
